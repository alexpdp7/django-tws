  type: str
  help: |
    Enter the name of the Django project this application belongs to.
app:
  type: str
  help: |
    Enter the name of the new app.
    Django apps are the modules of your project.
    If you are going to have more than a few models in your application, then use apps to separate between different functionalities.
    Prefer a short, lowercase name.
    (If needed, separate words with underscores.)
    If you will only have a few models, then you can pick a generic name such as "base", "app", etc.
app_camel_case:
  type: str
  help: |
    Enter the app name, but in camel case.
    If your app was foo_bar, then you would enter FooBar.
